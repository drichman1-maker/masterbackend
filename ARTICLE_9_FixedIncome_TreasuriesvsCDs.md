## The Safe Money Dilemma

You've got cash to invest but want:

- ✅ Guaranteed returns
- ✅ Easy access if needed

Two main options: **Treasury bonds** and **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)**.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Treasury Bonds | CDs |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Backed by** | US Government | FDIC (banks) |
| **Yield** | 4.0-4.5% (Feb 2026) | 4.0-4.8% |
| **Minimum** | $100 | $500-1,000 |
| **Liquidity** | High (sell anytime) | Low (penalty for early withdrawal) |
| **Tax** | No state/local tax | Fully taxable |
| **Safety** | "Risk-free" rate | FDIC insured to $250K |

## Treasury Bonds Explained

### Types:
- **T-Bills:** 4 weeks to 1 year (auctioned at discount)
- **T-Notes:** 2-10 years (pay interest every 6 months)
- **T-Bonds:** 20-30 years (long-term, higher yields)

### Pros:
- **Tax advantage:** No state/local income tax
- **Liquidity:** Sell on secondary market anytime

- **Transparency:** Daily pricing on TreasuryDirect

### Cons:
- **Price risk:** If rates rise, bond values fall
- **Complexity:** Auction process can confuse beginners
- **Tax reporting:** 1099-INT forms required

## CDs Explained

### Types:
- **Traditional CD:** Fixed rate, fixed term
- **No-penalty CD:** Can withdraw early (slightly lower rate)
- **Bump-up CD:** One rate increase allowed during term
- **Brokered CD:** Sold through brokerages (more liquid)

### Best CD Rates (February 2026)

- **Ally Bank:** 4.25% APY (1-year)
- **Capital One:** 4.20% APY (1-year)
- **Discover:** 4.15% APY (1-year)

### Pros:
- **Simplicity:** Open online in minutes
- **Predictability:** Fixed rate, no surprises
- **FDIC insured:** Up to $250K per bank

### Cons:

- **Auto-renewal traps:** May roll into lower rate

## When to Choose Treasuries

**Pick Treasuries if:**
- You're in a high state income tax bracket (CA, NY, NJ)
- You might need the money before maturity
- You want maximum safety
- You understand bond pricing

## When to Choose CDs

**Pick CDs if:**
- You want simplicity
- You won't need the money until maturity
- You're in a low/no state income tax state
- You found a rate significantly above Treasuries

## The Tax Advantage Math

Example: $10,000 investment, 4.5% yield

**CD (4.5%):**
- Federal tax (24%): $108
- State tax (6%): $27
- **After-tax return: $315**

**Treasury (4.3%):**
- Federal tax (24%): $103
- State tax (0%): $0
- **After-tax return: $327**

**Winner:** Treasury (in this scenario)

Use **Fixed Income Aggregator** to compare after-tax yields for your bracket.

## Laddering Strategy

Don't put all cash in one bond/CD. Build a ladder:

**Example 3-rung ladder ($30K):**
- $10K: 6-month CD/T-Bill
- $10K: 1-year CD/T-Note
- $10K: 2-year CD/T-Note

**Benefits:**
- Regular access to cash (every 6 months)
- Capture rising rates
- Reduce reinvestment risk

## Where to Buy

**Treasuries:**
- **TreasuryDirect.gov:** Direct from government (no fees)
- **Brokerage:** Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard (easier selling)

**CDs:**
- **Online banks:** Marcus, Ally, Capital One (best rates)
- **Credit unions:** Often competitive, local
- **Brokered CDs:** Fidelity, Schwab (more liquid)

## 2026 Outlook

With Fed potentially cutting rates in 2026:
- **Lock in rates now** if you believe cuts are coming
- **Stay short-term** (6-12 months) if you think rates will rise
- **Ladder approach** reduces timing risk

## Bottom Line

For most people in 2026:
- **High-tax states:** Treasuries win (tax advantage)
- **No/low-tax states:** CDs win (simplicity + slightly higher rates)
- **Best strategy:** 50/50 split with laddering
