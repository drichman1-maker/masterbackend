### Target Specs (High Demand)

**Sell Range:** $600-950 (M1), $900-1200 (M2)
**Target Margin:** $150-300 per flip

### Process
1. Set up alerts on MacTrackr for specific models

## 2. Expired Domain Watch

### Overview
Monitor expiring domains with good metrics, buy and resell or develop.

### What to Look For
- **Age:** 5+ years old
- **Backlinks:** Quality links from authority sites
- **Traffic:** Existing organic traffic
- **Brandability:** Short, memorable names
- **Extensions:** .com preferred, .io for tech

### Monitoring Tools
- **ExpiredDomains.net** (free, comprehensive)
- **NameJet** (premium drops)
- **SnapNames** (backordering)
- **DomainTools** (WHOIS history)
- **Distill.io** — Set up alerts for specific keywords

### Niches to Watch
- Health/wellness domains (match HealthIndex vertical)
- Tech/productivity (CodeMode audience)
- Gaming (Rumble audience)
- Finance/crypto
- Local service domains (plumbercity.com style)

### Metrics Threshold
- Domain Authority (DA) 20+
- Referring domains 50+
- Clean history (no spam penalties)
- Type-in traffic potential

### Acquisition
- **Drop Catching:** $8-15 registration
- **Auctions:** $50-500 (decent domains)
- **Backordering:** $20-50 (competitive drops)

### Exit Strategy
- **Quick Flip:** $200-2000 (sell to domainers)
- **Develop:** Build mini-sites, monetize
- **Park:** Earn ad revenue (low ROI)

### Process
1. Set up daily scans (ExpiredDomains filters)
2. Shortlist 5-10 domains weekly
3. Check backlink quality (Ahrefs/Moz)
4. Backorder or auction bid
5. Hold 6-12 months or flip immediately

### Selling Channels
