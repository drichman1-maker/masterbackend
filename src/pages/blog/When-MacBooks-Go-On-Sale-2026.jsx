        <h2>Trade-In Timing Strategy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before New Releases:</strong> Trade values are highest just before Apple announces new models.</li>
          <li><strong>After New Releases:</strong> Values can drop 15–25% within weeks of a new generation launching.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal Fluctuations:</strong> Trade values tend to be slightly higher in August–September and December.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Refurbished Inventory Cycles</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Post-Launch Surge:</strong> 2–3 months after new MacBooks release, refurbished inventory increases significantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Holiday Prep:</strong> October–November sees expanded refurbished inventory.</li>
          <li><strong>Tax Season:</strong> March–April brings another wave of inventory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p><strong>Do MacBooks ever go on sale at the Apple Store?</strong> Rarely. Apple typically maintains full retail pricing, leaving discounts to authorized retailers.</p>
        <p><strong>Is Black Friday really the best time to buy?</strong> For most buyers, yes. Black Friday and Cyber Monday consistently offer the deepest discounts.</p>
        <p><strong>Should I buy now or wait for the next sale?</strong> If you need a MacBook immediately, buy it. If your purchase is flexible, waiting for the next major sale can save $200+.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Timing your MacBook purchase is as important as choosing the right model. The 2026 sale calendar offers multiple opportunities to save, from spring refreshes to Black Friday blowouts. Historical patterns show that patient buyers who wait for transition periods between generations can save 15–25% compared to launch pricing. Set up price alerts on MacTrackr for your target MacBook model, and you'll never miss a deal.</p>
