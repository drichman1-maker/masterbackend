## About
**Headline:** Built by a solo founder who ships

I build fast, iterate faster, and focus on what moves the needle. CodeMode isn't an agency—it's my development practice. Every project is built with:

- **Speed to market:** MVPs in weeks, not months
- **Clean architecture:** Code that's easy to extend, not just ship
- **Data-driven:** Scrapers, APIs, and aggregators that actually work
- **Mobile-first:** iOS apps with push notifications and offline support

My stack is boring on purpose: TypeScript, React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL. Boring stacks ship. Interesting stacks stall.

## Selected Work
*(Link to case studies for MacTrackr, Health Index, DiamondData, MintCondition, Rumble)*

## Process

### 1. Discovery (Week 1)
We define scope, user flows, and data sources. No code until we're aligned on what "done" looks like.

### 2. Build (Weeks 2-5)
I work in sprints with weekly demos. You see progress, not promises.

### 3. Ship (Week 6)
Deploy to Vercel/Northflank, submit to App Store, hand over documentation.

### 4. Iterate (Ongoing)
Most projects need tuning post-launch. I stay on for 30 days to fix bugs and optimize.

**Fixed projects:** $5K-15K depending on scope
**Retainer:** $3K/mo for ongoing development
**Hourly:** $150/hr for small tasks

# BaselineDesigns — Portfolio Site Copy

## Hero Section
**Headline:** Design that converts
**Subheadline:** UI/UX design for digital products. Clean interfaces, clear hierarchy, and trust signals that turn visitors into users.

**CTA:** View work →

---

## About
**Headline:** Design is business, not art

I design for outcomes: lower bounce rates, higher conversions, clearer user flows. Every decision—color, type, spacing—serves the goal.

My process is research-driven:
- **Competitive analysis:** What's working in your space
- **User flows:** The shortest path to value
- **Visual hierarchy:** What users see first, second, third
- **Trust signals:** Reviews, badges, guarantees that reduce friction

I've designed for aggregators, marketplaces, SaaS tools, and mobile apps. The pattern is always the same: understand the user, remove friction, build trust.
