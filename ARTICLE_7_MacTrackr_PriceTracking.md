# How to Track iPhone Prices: Never Miss a Deal Again

**Meta Description:** "Learn how to track iPhone prices across retailers. Set up alerts, compare trade-in values, and time your purchase for maximum savings."

## Why iPhone Prices Fluctuate

Apple controls pricing tightly, but retailers compete:
- **Carrier deals:** Bill credits ($800+ over 24-36 months)
- **Trade-in bonuses:** Best Buy/Amazon offer extra during promotions
- **Refurbished market:** Apple certified vs third-party
- **Seasonal sales:** Black Friday, Prime Day, back-to-school

## Price Tracking Methods

### Method 1: Automated Alerts (Recommended)
Use **MacTrackr** to monitor:
- Amazon price history
- Best Buy deal drops
- Apple refurbished stock
- Carrier trade-in bonuses

Set your target price, get notified instantly.

### Method 2: Manual Checking
Check these weekly:
- **Apple Refurbished:** Tuesday mornings (new stock)
- **Amazon:** Check "Used & New" sellers
- **Best Buy:** Weekly ad (Sundays)
- **Swappa:** Peer-to-peer (often $50-100 cheaper)

### Method 3: Trade-in Arbitrage
1. Buy used iPhone on Swappa ($600)
2. Trade in to carrier ($800 credit)
3. **Profit:** $200 bill credit

*Check carrier trade-in values monthly—they change.*

## When to Buy (2026 Calendar)

| Month | Event | Typical Savings |
|-------|-------|-----------------|

| **July** | Prime Day | Current gen -10% |
| **September** | New iPhone launch | Previous gen -20% |
| **November** | Black Friday | Current gen -15% |

## Trade-in Value Tracking

Current iPhone trade-in values (February 2026):
- **iPhone 14 Pro Max:** $450-550
- **iPhone 14 Pro:** $400-500
- **iPhone 14:** $300-400
- **iPhone 13 Pro Max:** $350-450
- **iPhone 13:** $250-350

**Pro tip:** Carrier trade-ins are usually $50-100 higher than Apple trade-in.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Buying launch day** — Wait 2-3 months for first deals
❌ **Ignoring refurbished** — Apple Certified = new warranty, 15% cheaper
❌ **Missing carrier fine print** — Bill credits require 24-36 month commitment
❌ **Not comparing storage** — 256GB often better value than 128GB
