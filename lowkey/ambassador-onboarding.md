# Welcome to the LowkeyMode Crew

You're now a LowkeyMode Ambassador.

## Your code
```
LOWKEYMODE_[YOURNAME]
```
Share this however you like — text, post, word of mouth. When someone uses it, they get 1 month free before their year starts.

## How it works

We don't use tracking links. No pixels. No analytics on your shares.

All we see is how many times your code was redeemed. That's it.

| Redemptions | You get |
|-------------|---------|
| 5 | Free year of LowkeyMode |
| 15 | Free year + Founding Member badge |
| Top 3 monthly | $50 (crypto, PayPal, your choice) |

## Check your count

Message us anytime and we'll tell you your current number. We'll also post anonymous leaderboards monthly:

> "1. ZenMaster — 14 · 2. Anon42 — 11 · 3. CalmOne — 8"

Only your pseudonym shows. Never your contact info.

## What to say

Say whatever's true for you. Some ideas:

> "This app helped me actually stick with meditation. No data harvesting, no $15/month. Use my code LOWKEYMODE_[X] for a free month."

> "Finally a meditation app that doesn't feel like it's spying on me."

> "Group meditation > solo. LowkeyMode gets it."

## The rules

1. Don't spam
2. Don't make claims we can't back up
3. Be honest — if it's not for someone, that's fine

## Questions?
