## Arcads Brief

```
Actor type: Relatable 25-35 year old, casual setting (bedroom/living room), talking to camera

Script option 1 (Skeptic):
"Okay I was super skeptical about meditation apps. They all want your data, charge $15 a month, and honestly felt like homework. Then I found LowkeyMode. It actually measures the sound in your environment — like shows you the decibels and frequencies. And there's a community of people practicing together. It's $40 for the whole year and they don't store any of your info. I sound like an ad but I genuinely use this now."

Script option 2 (Personal):
"So I've had anxiety basically forever. Shallow breathing, racing thoughts, the whole thing. Started meditating in college when I joined this group and it actually helped. But every app I tried after felt lonely and expensive. LowkeyMode is different — you can see your environment's sound levels, practice with other people, and it's like $3 a month. No tracking, no BS. Worth a try if you're like me."

Style notes: Casual, unpolished feel, like genuine testimonial not ad. Natural pauses okay.
