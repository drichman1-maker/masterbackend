# 2026-02-11 Notes

## System Changes
- Removed Ollama from M3 to optimize storage and focus on cloud APIs (DeepSeek/Kimi/Claude)
- M3/M4 roles defined:
  - M3: Daily driver (dev work)
  - M4: 24/7 cron server (price checks every 2h)

## Model Strategy
- Primary: DeepSeek ($0.14/$0.28)
- Fallback 1: Kimi 2.5 ($0.20/$0.60)
- Fallback 2: Claude Haiku (direct API)
