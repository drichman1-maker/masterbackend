# Session Summary — Feb 17, 2026

## What Was Built
Both landing pages rebuilt with premium dark professional design (near-black bg, dark surface cards, gradient CTAs, pill badges).

**MacTrackr:** `mactrackr-web/index.html`
- Blue accent (#3b82f6)
- 6 product category cards (Mac, iPhone, iPad, Watch, AirPods, Accessories)
- Stats: categories, products tracked, update frequency, alerts

**HealthIndex:** `healthindex-web/index.html`  
- Cyan accent (#06b6d4)
- 4 category cards (Red Light, PEMF, Saunas, Recovery Tools)
- Stats: categories, products tracked, update frequency, alerts

## Key Lesson
**Never invent stats.** Only claim what actually exists: product counts, categories, features.

## Next
Deploy both to Vercel.
