3. Adorama (2-8% commission)
4. Apple Affiliate (2-12%, invite-only)
5. Walmart/Target (1-4%)

Action: Apply to Amazon + B&H first (biggest earners)

### RumbleGames Status
- ✅ Fully operational
- Shows game deals with discount percentages
- Price comparison table functional
- Dark theme with purple accents
- URL: https://rumbledeals.com

### Key Decisions
- **Product colors**: Display all colors in product specs, not separate listings
- **Color sorting**: Add color variant selector on product detail pages
- **Focus**: MacTrackr first (closest to completion), then Health Index, then others

## Session 4: Featured Products & Condition Toggle

### MacTrackr Homepage Enhancement
- Added "Featured Products" section below hero
- Shows 5 curated products: MacBook Air M4, MacBook Pro M5, iPad Pro, iPhone, Mac mini
- Grid layout: 1 mobile → 2 tablet → 3 desktop → 5 XL columns
- Displays category badge, product name, chip spec, and "FROM $X" pricing
- "View All" link routes to full product catalog
- Deployed to: https://mactrackr.com

### New/Refurbished Toggle (Phase 2)
- Created `ProductConditionContext` (similar to ThemeContext)
- Added toggle button in Navbar (next to theme toggle)
  - "New" state: white/gray styling with Package icon
  - "Refurb" state: green styling with RefreshCw icon
- Updated ProductCard to conditionally show refurbished prices
- Saves preference to localStorage

**Planned refurbished sources:**
- Apple Certified Refurbished (15-20% off)
- Amazon Renewed (10-25% off)
- Best Buy Open Box (10-15% off)

### Shared Components Status
- Found existing `/shared-components/` folder in workspace
- Contains: README, product.tsx (ProductCard, PriceDisplay), feedback.tsx
- **Note**: README specifies MacTrackr and Health Index are EXCLUDED from using shared components
- Shared library intended for: RumbleDeals, BabyGear, Appliances, Robot, SluggerData, MintCondition, CoinCurator, Auto, Fixed Income

### Model Updates
- Switched from DeepSeek to MiniMax-M2.5 as primary model
- Better performance, similar cost ($0.30/$1.00 vs $0.14/$0.28)
- Subagent default: Claude 3.5 Haiku ($1/$5) - more reliable than DeepSeek

### Blockers
- Backend still showing 20 products instead of 35 (Render deployment pending)
- Featured products section only showing 3 of 5 (iPad Pro, iPhone not yet available)
- Need to add `refurbishedPrices` field to backend products

### Tomorrow's Priority
- **SHIP PRICE ALERTS** for MacTrackr (user request Feb 17)
- Even simple version with email capture
- Don't let perfect be enemy of good

### Core Identity Established
**Privacy-First / Anonymous**
- No user accounts required
- No tracking cookies
- No data collection
- No email lists (unless explicit opt-in for alerts)
- Anonymous browsing by default
- Reference: codemodeapps.com copy
- **This is our competitive advantage against Big Tech aggregators**

### Additional Aggregator Ideas (New)
- **Auto Parts** - Car parts, accessories, maintenance items
- **Collectible Books** - First editions, signed copies, rare finds
- **Graded Comic Books** - CGC/CBCS graded comics, key issues, variants

## Session 5: Blog System & Final Polish

### Blog Infrastructure
- Created `/blog` page with article index
- Added Blog link to Navbar (top right) and Footer
- 4 SEO articles written by subagent:
  - Best MacBook for Video Editing 2026
  - M4 vs M3 Upgrade Guide
  - Refurbished Mac Mini Worth It
  - When Do MacBooks Go On Sale
- Articles saved in `/pages/blog/` with affiliate links and product tables

### MacTrackr Fixes
- Removed M3 MacBook Air (discontinued new)
- Added release years to products (2024, 2025)
- Footer category links now working with explicit navigation
- Products page set as default landing (no homepage bottleneck)
- Privacy policy live for affiliate compliance

### Outstanding Issues (Post-Dinner)
- Release years not displaying on frontend (debug needed)
- Buy Now / Visit links still routing to search pages (backend URL issue)
- Refurbished toggle shows same products (needs proper Apple refurb store integration)

### MintCondition Deployment (In Progress)
- Backend: Python Flask + eBay API ready
- Frontend: React ready
- Domain: mintcondition.app configured
- Status: Started deployment before dinner break

### SEO Strategy Committed
**Consumer-first approach:**
- Buying guides for specific use cases
- Upgrade decisions with benchmarks
- Deal timing and price history
- Honest refurbished vs new analysis
- No fluff, just helpful content that converts

### Tonight (Post-Dinner)
- Complete MintCondition deployment
- Debug MacTrackr direct URL routing
- Update memory with full status

### Tomorrow's Plan (Feb 18)
**MacTrackr:**
- Update blog articles with real content (Doug writing)
- Ship price alerts (n8n automation)
- Debug direct product URLs
- Apply Amazon Associates & B&H affiliate programs

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Build out shared backend for collectibles vs retailers
- Two different patterns:
  - **Collectibles:** MintCondition, RumbleDeals, SluggerData, Comics, CoinCurator, RareBooks
  - **Retailers:** BabyGear, MusicalInstruments, Robots, AutoParts, Grills
- Promote via social media/other channels

**Side Projects:**
- Shared components library
- Agent tasks for RumbleDeals UI rebuild
- Documentation for contractors

### User Notes
- Doug at dinner ~10pm, meditating
- Will send real product screenshots from Apple/Best Buy for accurate data
- RumbleDeals UI mockups available for frontend rebuild
- Wants agent instructions for 3 parallel tasks (RumbleDeals UI, shared backend, shared components)
- Refurbished: Link to Apple Certified Refurbished store for now (not scrape)
### 2026-02-17 Evening Session

**MintCondition (Pokemon)**
- Cloned pokemon-agg repo
- Set up with eBay API credentials
- Deployed: https://pokemon-agg.onrender.com (backend) + https://web-frontend-puce.vercel.app (frontend)
- User said frontend wasn't the right one - needs the antigravity version

**Health Index (Med-device)**
- Cloned med-device repo from GitHub
- Deployed to Vercel: https://med-device-chi.vercel.app
- User said it looks terrible - already had better version set up previously
- DECISION: Skip for now, focus on working projects first

**Reminder:** Stay focused on Tier 0 projects that are already working (MacTrackr, MintCondition). Don't get distracted by rebuilding/redeploying things that already exist in better form.
