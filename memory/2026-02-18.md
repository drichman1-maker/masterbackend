## Feb 18, 2026 — Session Notes

### Projects Checked
- **MacTrackr:** ✅ Live at mactrackr.com (200 OK)
- **RumbleGames:** ✅ Live at rumbledeals.com (200 OK)
- **MintCondition:** 🔄 Live at vercel URL but domain mintcondition.app failed (403 unauthorized)

### Actions Taken
1. Deployed MintCondition frontend to Vercel (duplicate deploy)
2. Tried to add mintcondition.app domain — got 403 error (domain not authorized)
3. Fixed Render deploy: Added `backend/render.yaml` for Python backend (was looking for package.json)
4. Pushed fix to GitHub — should auto-redeploy

### Issues Found
- **MintCondition backend:** Render failed looking for Node package.json — fixed with render.yaml
- **Refurbished prices:** Only 4 products have refurbishedPrices (MacBook Pro 14", 16", Mac Studio M2 Ultra, Mac Mini M4). All others (iPads, Watches, iPhones, AirPods) missing.

### Priorities Discussed
- Build out MintCondition (backend coming soon)
- Add refurbished products to MacTrackr (need sample data or Apple refurb store scraping)
- Affiliate applications: Amazon Associates pending
- Price alerts with n8n (not started)

### Next Steps
1. Wait for MintCondition backend redeploy on Render
2. Add refurbished prices to more MacTrackr products (sample or scraping)
3. Apply to Amazon Associates
4. Set up n8n price alerts
