# 2026-02-10 — Scaling Strategy & M1 Mac Mini Decision

## Scaling Strategy (Committed to Memory)

### Phase 1: Automation First (Current - $1K MRR)
| Task | Solution | Monthly Cost |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Customer Support | OpenClaw subagent → human escalation | $0.10/query |
| SEO Content | 16-subagent batch workflows | ~$10/week |
| Social Posting | Buffer + OpenClaw auto-drafts | $15/mo |
| Price Monitoring | Cron jobs + alerts | $0 |
| Email Sequences | ConvertKit automations | $29/mo |
| **Total** | | **~$50-70/mo** |

**vs. Hiring:** $5K+/mo for equivalent human labor

### Phase 2: Strategic Hiring ($1K-5K MRR)
| Role | Trigger | Cost | Alternative |
|------|---------|------|-------------|
| VA (General) | >50 support tickets/day | $5-10/hr | Better automation |
| DevOps | >1h downtime/month | $50-100/hr | Managed hosting |
| Content Editor | >200 AI drafts/week | $20/hr | Tighter prompts |
| Sales | Enterprise deals >$10K | Commission | Self-serve docs |

**Rule:** Hire only for bottlenecks automation can't fix.

### Phase 3: Revenue-Based Triggers
| MRR | Action |
|-----|--------|
| $0-1K | Full automation (you + OpenClaw) |
| $1-5K | Part-time VA ($10/hr, 10h/week) |
| $5-10K | Junior dev ($30/hr, 20h/week) |
| $10K+ | Dedicated ops person ($4K/mo) |

**Sweet spot:** Stay automated until $5K MRR, then hire one ops person.

### Hidden Scaling Levers
- **Rate limits:** Charge more or throttle free users
- **Self-serve docs:** Reduce support load
- **Community mods:** Empower users to help each other
- **API monetization:** Charge for high-volume access

### Next Steps (Committed)
1. Document all workflows (so they're hireable later)
2. Set revenue triggers (e.g., "At $3K MRR, hire VA")
3. Automate one bottleneck this week (e.g., support tickets → AI triage)

## M1 Mac Mini Decision

**Specs:** M1 / 16GB RAM / 256GB — **$300** (steal)

**Use case:** Dedicated OpenClaw cron server
- 24/7 uptime
- Headless operation
- Resale value: $450+ if flipped

**vs. DigitalOcean:**
- M1: $300 one-time, $0/month
- DO: $6-20/month forever
- Break-even: Month 15-50

**Verdict:** Buy the M1. Zero risk at $300.

## Open Questions

1. **LLC structure:** One LLC + multiple DBAs vs. separate LLCs per app?
2. **TaskBidder insurance:** Handyman liability — require COI at signup?
3. **Analytics timing:** Hold until traffic, but which tool? (Plausible vs. self-hosted)
4. **eBay API status:** Approval pending — alternative data sources?
5. **M1 setup:** Headless SSH or keep monitor attached for initial config?
