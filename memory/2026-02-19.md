# 2026-02-19 Summary

## ✅ Completed Today

### Backend (Unified Price Aggregator)
- Kimi built FastAPI backend with scrapers
- Pushed to GitHub: `drichman1-maker/kimi-mono`
- Deployed to Railway: `price-aggregator-api-production.up.railway.app`
- MacTrackr compatibility router with 7 products + direct URLs

### Products with Direct URLs
| Product | Retailers |
|---------|-----------|
| iPhone 16 128GB | Apple, Best Buy, Walmart, Target |
| iPhone 16 Pro Max | Apple, Best Buy, Walmart, Target |
| MacBook Air 13" M4 | Apple, Best Buy, Walmart |
| MacBook Pro 14" M4 | Apple, Best Buy, Walmart |
| iPad Air 11" M3 | Apple, Best Buy, Walmart, Target |
| Mac mini M4 | Apple, Best Buy |
| Apple Watch Series 10 | Apple, Best Buy, Walmart, Target |

### Frontend
- Connected MacTrackr to new Railway backend
- Created `shared-ui.tsx` components
- Vercel auto-deploying

### Infrastructure Notes
- Railway DATABASE_URL must be set manually (not auto-linked)
- Render Blueprint failed due to legacy plan names
- Cron jobs require starter+ plans

## ⏳ Pending

### Immediate
- [ ] Articles 3-6 (writing in parallel)
- [ ] Blog facelift (images, charts needed)
- [ ] WORKFLOW.md update (deployment patterns)
- [ ] MEMORY.md update (unified architecture)

### Expansion
- [ ] Add more products to API
- [ ] MintCondition integration (Pokemon)
- [ ] RumbleGames integration (video games)

## Key Learnings

### Deployment Patterns
1. Railway: DATABASE_URL must be manually set in Variables
2. Render: Cron needs starter plan; legacy database plans deprecated
3. Blueprint deployments fail on plan mismatches

### Architecture
- Unified backend supports multiple verticals via category routing
- Static data router works immediately; database for persistence later
- Direct URLs eliminate scraping complexity

## Next Session

### Priority 1
1. Test live MacTrackr with new backend
2. Add remaining products from Doug's list
3. Add direct URLs to existing products

### Priority 2  
1. WORKFLOW.md update (deployment lessons)
2. MEMORY.md update (architecture)
3. Blog facelift execution

### Priority 3
1. MintCondition data structure
2. RumbleGames integration
3. Vertical onboarding process docs
