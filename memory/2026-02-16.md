## Session Issues

### Token Limits
- Hit context limit, had to `/new` session at ~13:30
- Need to watch for this and proactively suggest new sessions when threads get long

## Project Priorities (Post-Reset)

### First Tier (Ship First)
1. **Health Index** — wellness machines aggregator, healthindex.com ✅
2. **MacTrackr** — Apple price tracker, backend FIXED & live, needs frontend polish
3. **LowKeyMode** — Xcode issues, may rebuild from scratch

### Second Tier (Ship What's Easy)
- MintCondition — Pokémon cards + comics (comics.mintcondition subdomain)
- TaskBidder.io — (new, needs domain check)
- Coin Curator — (new)
- Rumble Deals — (new)
- Slugger Data — baseball cards, sluggerdata.com ✅
- Baby Gear — babygear.codemodeapps.com (needs DNS)

**Rule**: 30-min blockers → pivot immediately. Build → Ship → Monetize → Revise → Repeat.

## Current Session Status (13:40 EST)

### LESSON LEARNED: Subagent Failures (AGAIN)
**Problem**: Subagents repeatedly:
1. Reported Health Index as "10% skeleton" when it's 70%+ built
2. Missed existing `.vercel` deployments
3. Only checked package.json, didn't inspect src/components/
4. Made assumptions without verifying

**Cost**: Wasted tokens (~130k across 3 subagents), delayed decisions, wrong priorities

**Solutions**:
1. **Stronger models for assessments** — DeepSeek failing at file inspection, use Claude/Haiku
2. **Specific instructions** — "Check src/components/, check .vercel/, verify deployment URL"
3. **Verify subagent work** — spot-check before acting on their reports
4. **Check memory first** — OVERNIGHT-PROGRESS-FEB16.md already had the status

### CORRECTION: Sites WERE Live Last Thursday!
Subagent assessments were wrong — both sites existed and were deployed:
- Health Index has `.vercel` folder (project ID: prj_iqnaVplI2nIy1gsxCA6xYCAPdhAl)
- MacTrackr has `.vercel` folder too
- OVERNIGHT-PROGRESS-FEB16.md shows: "✅ Environment configs ready...🔄 Waiting for backend health before deploying"

**Question**: What happened between Thursday and now? Did deployments get rolled back, domains fail, or projects deleted from Vercel?

### Assessment Results (3 subagents completed - NOW QUESTIONED)

**MacTrackr** — 30% ready, HIGHEST PRIORITY
- Stack: React + Vite + Tailwind + Recharts + React Router
- Backend: Live on Render ✅
- Issue: `api.js` backend URL needs verification/fix
- Blockers: Vercel config missing, backend connection unconfirmed
- Next: Fix api.js → Add vercel.json → Deploy to mactrackr.com

**Health Index** — ~70% ready (SUBAGENT WAS WRONG)
- Stack: Next.js 14 + Tailwind + TypeScript
- Components BUILT: Hero, WellnessCategories, FeaturedProducts, NewsletterSignup, Header, Footer
- Has `.vercel` folder (previously deployed)
- Content: 15 SEO articles exist but NOT integrated into site
- Blockers: Need article integration, affiliate links, domain connection check
- Next: Verify live deployment → Integrate articles → Add affiliate links

**LowKeyMode** — SYSTEM BLOCKED
- Issue: Xcode not set as active developer directory
- Can't assess project without fixing `xcode-select` first
- Decision pending: Fix Xcode setup OR rebuild from scratch
- Status: ON HOLD until web apps ship

### If Main Instance Goes Down (Sparky Handoff)
1. Check this file for current state
2. Priority order: MacTrackr → Health Index → LowKeyMode
3. MacTrackr: Fix `/mactrackr-frontend/src/api.js` backend URL, add `vercel.json`, deploy
4. Health Index: Site IS BUILT — just needs article integration + affiliate links
5. Goal: Live sites for affiliate applications (Amazon, ShareASale, Best Buy)
