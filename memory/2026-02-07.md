## Session Notes

### OpenClaw Setup & Configuration
- Doug is setting up OpenClaw, fresh install as of 2026-02-06
- Running on MacBook Air (ARM), macOS
- Currently using: Anthropic API key + Ollama (qwen3:8b, qwen3-vl:8b)
- Telegram channel configured
- Set model fallback: Opus → Haiku → Sonnet
- Subagents default model: Haiku (cost savings)
- Switched current session to ollama/qwen3:8b for cost savings

### Planned API Additions (not yet added)
Doug wants to add these providers (needs API keys first):
- Groq (groq.com)
- OpenRouter (openrouter.ai)
- Grok/xAI (x.ai)
- Moonshot/Kimi (moonshot.cn)

### Research: OAuth / Claude Pro vs API
- Confirmed: Claude Pro/Max subscription does NOT replace API credits
- They are completely separate billing systems
- Claude Code CLI can use Pro/Max via OAuth, but OpenClaw requires API credits

### Tools & Interests
- Uses Twin.so for automated tasks and research
- Interested in Claude Code for code review
- Wants to optimize API costs (using Ollama locally, Haiku for subagents)
- Asked about conserving credits — was told to /reset sessions

### Cost Optimization Research
- Found guides suggesting: local models → cheap providers → premium providers
- Best practice: Use free/cheap APIs (Groq, OpenRouter free) before hitting Claude
- Current fallback chain: Ollama → Groq → OpenRouter (free) → Grok → Moonshot → Claude

### TODO
- Added 4 providers (Groq, OpenRouter, xAI, Moonshot) ✅
- Updated fallback chain to save Claude credits ✅
- Need to add: DeepSeek, OpenAI, Pinecone, AIML API
- Research: No OAuth alternative found yet - API credits still required for Claude
