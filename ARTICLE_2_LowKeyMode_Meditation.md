## Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ **"I can't stop thinking"** — That's normal. Meditation isn't about empty mind; it's about noticing thoughts and returning to focus.

❌ **"I don't have time"** — 5 minutes is enough. Consistency > duration.

❌ **"I'm doing it wrong"** — If you're sitting and breathing, you're doing it right.
