# Sleep Sounds vs White Noise: Which Works Better?

**Meta Description:** "White noise, pink noise, or nature sounds? Science-backed guide to choosing the right sleep sound for better rest."

## The Science of Sleep Sounds

Your brain continues processing sounds during sleep. The right background noise can:
- **Mask disruptive sounds** (traffic, snoring, neighbors)
- **Reduce sleep onset time** by 40%
- **Improve deep sleep quality** (slow-wave sleep)
- **Prevent wake-ups** from sudden noises

## Types of Sleep Sounds

### White Noise
**What:** Equal volume across all frequencies (sounds like TV static)
**Best for:** Blocking sudden noises, tinnitus relief
**Science:** Most studied, proven effective for sleep onset
**Try:** LowKeyMode "brown_noise" file (deeper than white noise)

### Pink Noise
**What:** More power in lower frequencies (sounds like rainfall)
**Best for:** Deep sleep enhancement, memory consolidation
**Science:** May improve slow-wave sleep by 15%
**Try:** LowKeyMode "pink_noise" file

### Brown Noise
**What:** Even deeper than pink (sounds like distant thunder)
**Best for:** Anxiety, racing thoughts, high-stress sleepers
**Science:** Lower frequencies most calming to nervous system
**Try:** LowKeyMode "brown_noise" file (user favorite)

### Nature Sounds
**What:** Rain, ocean, forest, streams
**Best for:** People who find noise machines artificial
**Science:** Mixed results—some find them calming, others distracting
**Try:** LowKeyMode "ambient_flow" (water + low tones)

## Which Should You Choose?

**Start with brown noise if:**
- You have anxiety or racing thoughts
- You need to block loud environments
- White noise feels too "harsh"

**Start with pink noise if:**
- You want deep sleep improvement
- You wake up feeling unrefreshed
- You're over 40 (deep sleep naturally declines)

**Start with nature sounds if:**
- Electronic sounds bother you
- You miss camping/outdoor sleep
- You have low baseline anxiety

## Volume Matters

**Too loud:** Can damage hearing over time, disrupt sleep
**Too quiet:** Won't mask disruptive sounds

**Sweet spot:** Just loud enough to mask your environment. If you can hold a conversation over it, it's too loud.

## Speaker Placement

- **Near head:** Best masking effect
- **Across room:** More ambient, less direct
- **Under pillow:** Only if speaker is flat (avoid heat buildup)

## Apps vs Dedicated Devices

| Feature | Phone Apps | Dedicated Machines |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | Free-$5/mo | $20-100 |
| **Sound quality** | Varies | Usually better |
| **Battery drain** | Yes | No (plugged in) |
| **Travel** | Convenient | Bulky |
| **Alarms** | Built-in | May conflict |

**Recommendation:** Start with free app (LowKeyMode), upgrade to dedicated device if you use nightly.

## The 7-Day Test

Don't give up after one night:
- **Nights 1-2:** Adjustment period (may feel weird)
- **Nights 3-4:** Starting to notice benefits
- **Nights 5-7:** Determine if it's working for you

Try each type for 7 days. Track sleep quality (phone apps or Oura ring).
